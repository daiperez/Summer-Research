# Summer-Research
Codes that are relevant for my summer research at Dr.Dawes' lab.
These codes aim to successfully control 2 Tello drones in hopes to align them in order to conduct optic experiments.

The Library Project Code notebook consists of code needed to successfully count the number of patrons in Pacific University's library.
